# LoanFilms_DatabaseProject
Database project for managing a movie films. The database was designed with the UML model in Sybase PowerDesigner.  The class diagram has been transformed into the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), where classes correspond to  individual entities, objects to entity attributies. However individual relantionships between classes will be  transformed into the approbiate relations or associations. The association class in the UML class model in the  conceptual diagram will be transformed to entities with two associations. Correctly generated entity relationships  model will be transformed into a physical model (PDM), where the entity will correspond to the table, the entity's  attributes to the corresponding columns of the table. Relationships in the physical model will be transformed to  references while entity with two associations will correspond to the table and two associations between the endpoints  of the association class. The physical model has been created indexes in order to faster searching of records, views  that display the most important data on loan and stored procedures and triggers. After designing the physical model  will be generated SQL scripts, that contains the entire structure of the database. The physical model was connnected  to the Microsoft SQL Server database using the ODBC driver. Ready SQL script can be run automatically by clicking F5  or Execute in SQL Server program.
